Problem
We need to find a specified element within an array and display its index withing the array.

Linear Search

**Shorter version**

1. Repeat for each element in the array, starting at the first element:
    1.1 If the current element is the one we are looking for:
        - Report the element (or its index).
        - Stop the search.
    1.2 Otherwise, move to the next element.
2. If the end of the array is reached and the element was not found:
    - Report that the element is not in the array.

**Longer version**

Initialize i to 0, representing the index of the array we are currently checking.

Start iterating across the array from the first element:

Check if the current element is the one we are looking for:

    - If the current element is the one we are looking for:
        - Alert: "The specified element is found and its index is " + i
        - Stop the search.
    - If the current element is not the one we are looking for and we are not at the last position of the array:
        - Increment i by 1.
        - Continue to the next iteration.
    - Else:
        - Stop the search.
        - Alert: "The specified element is not found in the array."
