! Ex. 4.2.1 (**) - FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
"FizzBuzz".

! Ex. 4.2.2 (**)
Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 10. (use nested loops)
1 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
2 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20
3 3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
4 4 8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40
5 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50
6 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60
7 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70
8 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80
9 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90
10 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100

! Ex. 4.2.3 (**) - The world translater ca. 30 min
Write a function named helloWorld that:
• Takes 1 argument, a language code (e.g. "es", "de", "en")
• Returns "Hello, World" for the given language, for at least 3 languages. It should default to returning
English.
Call the function for each of the supported languages and log the result to make sure it works.

Ex. 4.2.4 (**) - Retirement calculator ca. 90 min
Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement and the year you can retire.
It should prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire and display the output as shown in the
example below.
• What is your current age? 25
• At what age would you like to retire? 65
• You have 40 years left until you can retire.
• It’s 2024, so you can retire in 2064.

Ex. 4.2.5 (**) - Sum and Average
Write a program that asks the user to input five numbers, print the sum and the average of the five numbers.

Ex. 4.2.6 (**) - Decimal/Binary conversion
a) Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints the binary representation of the number.
(If you don’t know what a binary representation is, look it up. Computers use binary to represent
numbers.)
Note: e.g. 25 in binary is 11001
b) Write another program that does the inverse operation - converting binary to decimal.

Ex. 4.2.7 (**)
a) Write a program that asks the user for a password and checks if it is valid. The password must
• at least be 8 characters long
• include 1 special symbol
• include 1 number
• not include a space or either
b) Write a program that generates a password according to the requirements above. Use your validator
written in a).
