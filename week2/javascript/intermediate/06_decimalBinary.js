// Decimal/Binary conversion
// a) Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints the binary representation of the number.
// (If you donâ€™t know what a binary representation is, look it up. Computers use binary to represent
// numbers.)
// Note: e.g. 25 in binary is 11001
// b) Write another program that does the inverse operation - converting binary to decimal.
