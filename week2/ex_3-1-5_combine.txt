Combine Ex. 3.1.2 and 3.1.4 into one program.
The program should ask the user if they want to add or subtract two numbers. Then the program should ask
for the two numbers and print the result.

1. Prompt the user for operation: to add or to subtract. Store the answer in a variable C. 
If the answer is "add", proceed with addition. If the answer is "subtract", proceed with subtraction.

2. Prompt the user for two numbers and store them in variables A and B.

3. Create a variable Result to store the result of the calculation.

4. If the user has chosen to add:
    4.1 Set Result as the sum of A and B.
    4.2 Print the value of Result.
    4.3 Exit the program.

5. If the user has chosen to subtract:
    5.1 Compare the values of A and B:
        5.1.1 If A > B, set Result to A - B.
        5.1.2 If A <= B, set Result to B - A.
    5.2 Print the value of Result.
