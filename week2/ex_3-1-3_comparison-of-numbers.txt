Which number is bigger? 

Declare 2 variables, both numbers. Compare which number is greater Log the output,
e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10." Add an output for the else statement, e.g. The smaller number

1. Declare two variables A and B, both of type number.
2. Create a variable C for the output, which will be of type string.
3. Compare the values of A and B:
    3.1 If A > B, set C as the concatenation of the strings: "The greater number of " + variable A + " and " + variable B + " is " + variable A.
    3.2 If A < B, set C as the concatenation of the strings: "The greater number of " + variable A + " and " + variable B + " is " + variable B.
    3.3 Else, set C to "Both numbers are equal".
4. Print the string stored in variable C.
