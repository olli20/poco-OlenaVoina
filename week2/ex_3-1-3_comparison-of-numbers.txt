Which number is bigger? 

Declare 2 variables, both numbers. Compare which number is greater Log the output,
e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10." Add an output for the else statement, e.g. The smaller number

Comparsion / Variant 1
1. Initialize two variables A and B, both of type number.
2. Create a variable C for the output, which will be of type string.
3. Compare the values of A and B:
    3.1 If A > B, set C as the concatenation of the strings: "The greater number of " + variable A + " and " + variable B + " is " + variable A.
    3.2 If A < B, set C as the concatenation of the strings: "The greater number of " + variable A + " and " + variable B + " is " + variable B.
    3.3 Else, set C to "Both numbers are equal".
4. Print the string stored in variable C.

Comparsion / Variant 2
    Initialize numberOne to 0;
    Initialize numberTwo to 0;
    Initialize output to an empty strring;

    Prompt for numberOne with "What is the first number?"
    Prompt for numberTwo with "What is the second number?"

    Convert numberOne to a number;
    Convert numberTwo to a number;

    Choose one of the actions, based on the conditions:
        1. If numberOne > numberTwo
            output = "The greater number of " + numberOne + " and " + numberTwo " is " + numberOne

        2. If numberOne < numberTwo
            output = "The greater number of " + numberOne + " and " + numberTwo " is " + numberTwo

        3. If numberOne == numberTwo
            output = "Both numbers are equal"

    Display output;
