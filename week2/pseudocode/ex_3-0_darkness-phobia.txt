DARKNESS PHOBIA
One family wants to get through a tunnel. Dad can make it in 1 minute, mama in 2 minutes, son in 4 and
daughter in 5 minutes. Unfortunately, not more than two persons can go through the narrow tunnel at one
time, moving at the speed of the slower one.
Can they all make it to the other side if they have a torch that lasts only 12 minutes and they are afraid of the
dark?

Calculating the min time to get to another side of the tunnel

The following solution takes 13 min, and does not solve the problem

1. Papa & Mana      >> 2 min
2. Papa goes back   << 1 min
3. Papa & Son       >> 4 min
4. Papa goes back   << 1 min
5. Papa & Daughter  >> 5 min
