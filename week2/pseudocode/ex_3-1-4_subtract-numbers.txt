SUBSTRACION
Allow the user to input numbers, subtract the smaller from the bigger number and print the result.

1. Prompt the user for two numbers and store them in variables A and B.
2. Create a variable C to hold the result of the subtraction.
3. Compare the values of A and B:
    3.1 If A > B, set C as the result of the subtraction A - B.
    3.2 If A <= B, set C as the result of the subtraction B - A.
4. Print the result stored in C.
