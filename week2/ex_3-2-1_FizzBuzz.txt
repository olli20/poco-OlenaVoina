Ex. 3.2.1 - FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print
"FizzBuzz".

1. Initialize counter i to 1.
2. Create a loop that repeats 100 times. In each iteration increase i by 1. The loop repeats until i <= 100
    2.1 If i is devisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz";
    2.2 If i is devisible by 3, print "Fizz";
    2.3 If i is devisible by 5, print "Buzz";
    2.4 Else, print i.
