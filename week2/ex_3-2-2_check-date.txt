Write a program that asks the user for a date. Find the day of the year for the given date. For example,
January 1st would be 1, and December 31st is 365.
a. Do not include leap years.
b. Include leap years. Check the rules for leap years on the internet, and implement them in your program.


* Without leap years *

Init array allMonths = [{month: 01, days: 31}, {month: 02, days: 28}, {month: 03, days: 31}, {month: 04, days: 30}, {month: 05, days: 31}, {month: 06, days: 30}, {month: 07, days: 31}, {month: 08, days: 31}, {month: 09, days: 30}, {month: 10, days: 31}, {month: 11, days: 30}, {month: 12, days: 31}]

Init totalDays = 0 for output.

Prompt user for inputDate = "Enter a date (Month/Day/Year)"

Validate inputDate (ensure format is correct)

Convert inputDate into {month: mm, day: dd}
Init {month, day} = the converted date object

If month = 1 then
    totalDays = day
    Print totalDays
    End

Else
    Init fullMonths = month - 1
    Init counter = 0
    
    Repeat until counter < fullMonths
        totalDays = totalDays + allMonths[counter].days
        counter = counter + 1
    
    totalDays = totalDays + day
    Print totalDays
    End
